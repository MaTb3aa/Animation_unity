Maze-Game

As you all know, a maze is a structure surrounded by walls with numerous paths and passages, making it difficult for anyone to pass from one end of the maze to the other. Just like the actual maze, I developed a game which will have big walls as border and small internal walls to create confusion for the player. This Game have many Function like :

1-Levels the game have many level from easy level to hard one
2-every level have time you should reach to the final before finishing the time or you will replay the game again
3-small camera for every level
4-for every Level have own music .
